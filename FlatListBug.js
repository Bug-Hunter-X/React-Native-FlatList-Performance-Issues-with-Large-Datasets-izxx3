This React Native bug arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as erratic behavior, including slow scrolling, dropped frames, and even crashes.  This is often due to inefficient rendering of list items, especially when components within the items re-render unnecessarily or perform expensive operations during rendering.
